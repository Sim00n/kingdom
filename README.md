Kingdom
=======

Testing and messing around with java and networking.
The game is made following a tutorial by TheCherno.
Networking, chats, server, etc. done solely by me and probably breaking every rule of organized, clean programming. Oh well ... gotta learn somehow.

* The main idea is to make a top-view, castle defense kind of game.
* Mechanics will be similar to League of Legends (as in 3-4 skills that you can improve over the course of 1 match).
* Teams of probably 3 to 10 people (depending on how involved the fighting will be).

Progress
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#####Update #2
I think I have figured out basic networking and how to send stuff back and forth. I also added projectiles, basic particles, some chat functionality and cleaned up the code a tiny bit. There's a lot of work to do but I'm slowly moving forward. What's next? Better particles, better animation sync, >>better collisions<<, some path finding maybe in the long run? I want to finally switch movement from the keyboard to the mouse so I can play with different skills/spells.

#####Update #1
Working on networking now. Once that is completely finished I'll get to projectiles, skills and syncing all that.
